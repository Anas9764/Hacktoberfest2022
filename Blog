## What is frontend development?
- A front-end developer creates websites and applications using web languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allow users to access and interact with the site or app. When you visit a website, the design elements you see were created by a front-end developer.
- Frontend development usually assumes making the websites more interactive — with typography, buttons, layouts, forms and all other web design improvements which include web engineering visible and actionable on the client-side.

- Frontend developers are people who build amazing websites via code and markup text. Using frontend techniques and technologies, frontend developers can basically write websites from scratch or, what is more common today considering that it saves a lot of time, apply the design onto an existing theme and adjust it to the client’s needs.

- A frontend developer’s work entails writing the website code based on a PSD design file received from a web designer, thus creating the backbone of a website in HTML and styling it with CSS or adding smooth functionalities in JavaScript. Since websites are accessed from different devices and browsers, frontend developers make sure they are equally visible on all devices and across browsers with the power of responsive design and CSS stylesheets.
